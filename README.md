# uv-fasthtml project template

This is a very basic [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml) project template
which uses the [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager.
It aims to introduce sound architecture and testing practices from day
one of a project.

## How to use it

A Runfile is provided for your convience. See all commands with `./run`.

`./run restore` fetches all dependencies, and `./run serve` spawns a
server.

When deploying to production, disable autoreload and hide it behind
a [reverse
proxy](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-nginx-as-a-reverse-proxy-on-ubuntu-22-04).
